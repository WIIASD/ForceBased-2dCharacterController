# ForceBased-2dCharacterController in Unity

This is my implementation of what I have learned from this DevGamm video: https://youtu.be/YDwp5tNCKso

Also I made some changes to fit what I need for a 2DCharacterController (ex. I used raycast to do ground check and wall check rather than calling the OnCollision methods)
